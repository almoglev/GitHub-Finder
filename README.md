# Github Finder App

This is a hands-on project I developed while self-learning the course [React Front To Back 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-front-to-back-2022/) by Brad Traversy on Udemy.
GitHub Finder is a web application to search GitHub users and display their info.

Tech Stack:
- React 
  including:
  - Props
  - State
  - Hooks
  - Reducers
  - Routes
- Styling with Tailwind & Daisy UI
- GitHub API
- HTTP Requests

## Usage

Rename **_.env.example_** to **_.env_**

You can use the Github API without a personal token, but if you want to use your token, add it to the .env file

Learn how to create a token [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)

### Install Dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Run

```
npm start
```
